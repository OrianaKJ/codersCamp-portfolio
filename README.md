# Portfolio project
This is the first project for CodersCamp course. The goal was to create a portfolio containing information about the author and completed projects.
You can preview demo of this project here: https://orianakj.github.io/codersCamp-portfolio/

## The project should include:
- box-model
- cascade
- CSS selectors
- popular HTML tags
- CSS connection with HTML
- saving colors
- text styling
- external icons / fonts (fontawesome, google fonts)
- flexbox / grid
- position (absolute, relative)
- keyframes animations
- bootstrap
In small projects like this it is not necessary to use flex, grid and bootstrap.

## What additional functionalities does my project have?
- contact form with the modal that is launched after clicking the send button
- media queries for screens with max-width: 500px and max-width: 768px
- custom console.log message

### My project section
Here, there are currently empty cards that, along with new projects, will be exchanged for short project information with a screenshot.
In my design, depending on the screen size, there is different number of columns displayed. 

Three columns for screens over 768px:
